00.dates_correction.ipynb
    * Filter: transaction_date >= 2015-11-01
    * Correction of dates:
       + for non-cancel transactions:
         [tr: transaction date 
          st: start date (i.e., expiration date minus number of days of the subscription plan)
          ex: expiration date]
 
          - if tr <= st <= ex: no correction 
          - if st < tr <= ex: (corrected start date) = tr
          - if st <= ex < tr: (corrected start date) = (corrected expiration date) = null
                              (The record is to be ignored/removed.)

       + for cancels:
         (Note. For cancels, expiration date means the adjusted/advanced expiration date
          for the previous subscription.)
          - if tr <= ex: no correction
          - if ex < tr: (corrected expiration date) = tr


01.find_problematic_members.ipynb
    Find members who has >= 3 transaction records on one date, of which at least one is 
    non-cancel and at least one is a cancel. Those transactions might be more difficult to
    handle.


02.exclude_problematic_members.ipynb
    * Remove all records of problematic members.
    * Filter: corrected expiration date != null.
    * Add "tid" (transaction id).


03.subscription_periods.ipynb
    * Shorten the subscriptions (corrected start day, corrected expiration day) that are 
      affected by cancels. The results are called "(effective) subscription periods".
    * Also find indeterminate periods (within which the state of subscription cannot be
      determined, due to one cancel and one non-cancel transaction on the same date).
    * The output has columns "msno", "tid", "start_date", "end_date". 
       + If a record is a subscription period, "tid" is the normal transaction id (in the 
         output of previous).
       + If a record is an indeterminate period, "tid" is "indeterm".


10.prepare_subscrip-periods_for_feature-creation.ipynb
    * join with train.csv
    * remove members with indeterminate dates after 2016-10-01
    * remove members with latest end_date < 2017-01-01
    * remove records with end_date < 2016-10-01
